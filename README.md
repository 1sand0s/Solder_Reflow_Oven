<h1>Solder Reflow Oven Controller</h1>

<h3>About</h3>
I built this following my fifth semester course on control systems. It uses a AT90USB646 mcu to implement PID along with a AD595AQ temperature sensor.
This PCB was built at home using the PCB toner transfer method and hydrochloric acid/hydrogen peroxide as etchant.
