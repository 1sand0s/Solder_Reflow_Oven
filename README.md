<h1>Solder Reflow Oven Controller</h1>

<h3>About</h3>
I built this following my fifth semester course on control systems. It uses a AT90USB646 mcu to implement PID along with a AD595AQ temperature sensor.
Some of the silkscreen contents are drawn on F.cu layer since this PCB was built at home using the traditional FeCl3 and laser printer method.
More details will be added on my blog
